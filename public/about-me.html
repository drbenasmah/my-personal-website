    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm Dr. Ben Asmah, a former doctor from Ghana who is now fully focused on developing blockchain solutions to improve healthcare in Ghana and Africa.
    </p>

    <p>
      I obtained my MBBS in China and had the opportunity to rotate in some of the biggest hospitals in China, Australia, and Ghana during my studies.
    </p>

    <p>
      After working for two years as a doctor in Ghana, I realized that I could do more to help improve the healthcare system than just being a doctor. That's when I discovered blockchain technology and its potential to shape the healthcare industry in Ghana and Africa.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm particularly interested in telehealth, especially in rural areas, and I believe that combining my skills as a medic and blockchain developer will allow me to have the biggest positive impact in this space.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since childhood, I've been passionate about accessible healthcare for my village, which led me to become a doctor. But I knew I could do more, and in November 2022, I quit everything I was doing in Japan to pursue a software engineering program with ALX_Africa and a 6-month bootcamp with Hackathon with Encode_Club fulltime. I am fully committed to this journey and won't stop until I am done.
    </p>

    <p>
      I strongly believe that blockchain will enhance healthcare in the near future, and I want to be a part of its development. I'm always eager to learn and expand my knowledge, and I'm open to collaborating with like-minded individuals and organizations to create innovative solutions for healthcare in Ghana and Africa.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's connect and see how we can work together towards a brighter future for healthcare in Africa.
    </p>
